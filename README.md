# 🧠 Hair Analysis Tool

The Hair Analysis Tool is a computer vision-based application designed to analyze hair coverage within a specific region of the scalp, using hairline detection techniques. It provides visual and quantitative insights about hair density, which can be useful for research, cosmetic evaluations, or medical diagnostics.

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 **Hairline Detection** — Uses a robust API to detect the frontal hairline in input images.
- 📏 **Hair Coverage Calculation** — Measures hair coverage within the detected region, pixel-by-pixel.
- 📊 **Visualization** — Annotates and visualizes hairline boundaries and coverage areas on the original image.
- 📁 **Batch Support** — Process multiple images in one go (optional extension).

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Python** 🐍
- **OpenCV** for image processing
- **NumPy** for numerical operations
- Optional: Matplotlib / Streamlit for visualization or UI (if applicable)

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Input**: The user uploads or provides an image of a scalp or head region.
2. **Hairline Detection**: The image is sent to a hairline detection API, which returns boundary coordinates.
3. **Coverage Analysis**: The tool evaluates pixel intensity or pattern within the region under the detected hairline.
4. **Output**: A report with metrics such as:
   - Hair coverage %
   - Visualization with bounding regions
   - Optional: CSV of data points or summary chart
